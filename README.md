uhh kind of a discord ""client"" written in python,doing this for learning pourposes,probably not gonna turn into something useful

# How to run
pip install requests websocket_client

python3 menu.py

you will also need to put usertoken in bruh.py !

to exit do CTRL-C

# Can i see the source and use it?
feel free to do so.

# Why?
the discord official app is cancer,and it takes too many resources for me,so why not do a 10x lighter,more platform friendly(and less user friendly :gene:) app!
