# Why it exists?
Let me put it this way... Just a demo of the discord api :)
# Source code is open?
If the plus version exists, then the original author terrawolf34 has allowed use this code free. Although I think he doesn't care.... whatever
# What about Plus, why you made plus?
The project is a bit abandoned... like, uh... 8 months ago was the last update(status of October 12 2023) if my memory serves me correctly. I've decided to improve the app a bit, and I'll probably release updates if I have time (but not for sure).
# Hm GUI for it!
There will be, but I don't know why yet..... But it will
# What mean Lemn?
Lemn it wood on Romanian, yes, I didn't know either...
# What about Pull requests
Of course! You'll make a big difference if you do! But nothing bad... okay?
# Will it be merged with the original?
Never. And don't ask why
